# Hydration-Helper

A questionnaire app to tell you how much water you should drink in a day. This app was supposed to be able to let you keep track of how much water you were drinking everyday by having a questionnaire and then a screen that you'd check in every so often throughout the day to add up how much water you drank. It would also have kept a daily record of all the days that you managed to meet that recommended daily number as well as occasional push notifications for hydration reminders. However, I severly underestimated the amount of time it would take finish it as it took me WAY TOO LONG to even set up the questionnaire. I totally could have skipped the questionnaire part and just went for the daily tracker part but I thought it would only take me a day to finish that questionnaire. I have to finish another app by Friday so due to time constraints i'll have to abandon that feature and leave the app as it is for now.
